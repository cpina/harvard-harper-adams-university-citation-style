# Harper Adams University style

## Problems

* The style says that edition in a book should be `2<sup>nd</sup>`. This is not supported by CSL: https://discourse.citationstyles.org/t/9th-edition-9-sup-th-sup-ed/1594
* The style says that a person named "Jean-Luc Smith" should be "Smith, J". CSL supports only "Smith, JM" or "Smith, J-M": https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/368309#Comment_368309
