 abstract = {Brassica seed crops are grown throughout New Zealand and worldwide, and inter-crop and crop-weed contamination through gene flow is a major concern. For Brassica, large arthropods (body length ¿ 3 mm), particularly honey bees, are the most important pollinators and are considered key vectors of pollen. Small arthropods (body length ¡ 3 mm) are also abundant in Brassica crops but their role as pollinators is rarely assessed. Numerous small arthropods (particularly Diptera and Thysanoptera) were recorded within cages surrounding pak choi inflorescences that excluded large arthropods. Inflorescences inside these cages set seed, but seed set was significantly reduced compared with inflorescences in cages that were hand pollinated and uncaged inflorescences. Although the presence of large arthropods significantly increased seed set, the role of small arthropods and wind cannot be excluded in pak choi pollination. Further studies are required to fully determine the role of small arthropods in long distance pollen flow.},

 abstract = {Pollination, pest control, and soil properties are well known to affect agricultural production. These factors might interactively shape crop yield, but most studies focus on only one of these factors at a time. We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.},

 abstract = {A hypothesized underlying principle of the diversity-functioning relationship is that functional groups respond differently to environmental change. Over 3 years, we investigated how pollinator diversity contributes to the magnitude of pollination service through spatial complementarity and differential response to high winds in California almond orchards. We found honey bees preferentially visited the top sections of the tree. Where wild pollinators were present, they showed spatial complementarity to honey bees and visited the bottom tree sections more frequently. As wind speed increased, honey bees’ spatial preference shifted toward the bottom tree sections. In high winds (¿2.5 m sÀ1), orchards with low pollinator diversity (honey bees only) received almost no flower visits. In orchards with high pollinator diversity, visitation decreased to a lesser extent as wild bee visitation was unaffected by high winds. Our results demonstrate how spatial complementarity in diverse communities can help buffer pollination services to environmental changes like wind speed.},
