	abstract={Economic valuation of crop pollination services, including potential monetary losses in agricultural production induced by insufficient pollination, is a strategy to quantify the impacts of this critical ecosystem service on food production, food security and the global economy, and to drive policy actions. We examined how the economic valuation of crop pollination services has been investigated across the ecological and economics literature and review estimates of monetary values of crop pollination services, as well as the investments (research funding/grants) and policy actions associated with pollinators and pollination. We documented an increase in the number of economic valuation studies on pollination services in the last two decades, with a substantial growth over the last five years, which represented 54% of all publications. However, we emphasize that there is a marked lack of data on regionally important commercial crops that are essential for the food security of many millions of people, particularly in developing countries. Estimated global values of the crop pollination service, adjusted for inflation in March/2020, range widely from US$195 billion to ~US$387 (US$267–657) billion annually — due to methodology, input data and a historical increase in production costs of pollinator-dependent crops. There is an increasing trend over time in the values of crop pollination service estimates for the full set of main globally-grown crops, although estimates for specific crops are widely variable at local to regional scales. Research funding on pollination/pollinators is mainly in developed countries, which have published all the reviewed policy papers on the economic value of crop pollination services. Although the valuation of pollination services, and associated economics and policy remain embryonic areas of research, animal-mediated pollination is clearly a highvalue environmental service, which greatly strengthens conservation arguments worldwide.},

This systematic review examines the quality of reporting for two statistical tests, t-tests and ANOVA, for papers published in a selection of physiology journals in June 2017. Of the 328 original research articles examined, 277 (84.5%) included an ANOVA or t-test or both. However, papers in our sample were routinely missing essential information about both types of tests: 213 papers (95% of the papers that used ANOVA) did not contain the information needed to determine what type of ANOVA was performed, and 26.7% of papers did not specify what post-hoc test was performed. Most papers also omitted the information needed to verify ANOVA results. Essential information about t-tests was also missing in many papers. We conclude by discussing measures that could be taken to improve the quality of reporting.},

	abstract = 	 {The New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) is a multi-temporal, thematic classification of New Zealand's land cover. It identifies 33 mainland land cover classes (35 classes once the offshore Chatham Islands are included). The classification was revised between versions 1, 2, and 3 but has been consistent thereafter, and always with backward compatibility maintained. Land cover features are described by a polygon boundary, a land cover code, and a land cover name at each nominal time step; summer 1996/97, summer 2001/02, summer 2008/09, summer 2012/13, and summer 2018/19. The data set is designed to complement in theme, scale and accuracy, New Zealand’s 1:50,000 topographic database (https://www.linz.govt.nz/land/maps/topographic-maps/topo50-maps). LCDB is suitable for use in national and regional environment monitoring, forest and shrubland inventory, biodiversity assessment, trend analysis and infrastructure planning. The classification used in LCDBv5.0 is presented in the document 'LCDBClassesAtVersion5.pdf' and a table correlating LCDB classes over all versions is presented in the document 'LCDBClassCorrelations.pdf'. Both of these are among the accessory documents to this dataset in the LRIS portal (https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/). LCDB version 5.0 was released in January 2020 and includes corrections to all time steps 1997/97, 2001/02, 2008/09, 2012/13 and 2018/19 for both the New Zealand mainland and Chatham Islands. A description of work undertaken for this release (including that of all earlier releases) is presented in the Lineage section. Of particular note at version 5.0 is the addition to LCDB, of attributes designed to readily identify and monitor wetlands over time and a similar capability to manage significant coastal changes. “EditAuthority” and "EditDate" are attributes, maintained since version 3.0 to indicate authorship and nominal date of polygon mapping, edit or change. Errors in the data due to misclassification (rather than land cover change) or poor delineation can be reported to Landcare Research for inclusion in the next release using the online feedback facility in https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/.},

	abstract={Weather plays an important role in spring-blooming fruit crops due to the combined effects on bee activity, ßower opening, pollen germination, and fertilization. To determine the effects of weather on highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., productivity, we monitored bee activity and compared fruit set, weight, and seed number in a Þeld stocked with honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and common eastern bumble bees, Bombus impatiens (Cresson). Flowers were subjected to one of Þve treatments during bloom: enclosed, open, open during poor weather only, open during good weather only, or open during poor and good weather. Fewer bees of all types were observed foraging and fewer pollen foragers returned to colonies during poor weather than during good weather. There were also changes in foraging community composition: honey bees dominated during good weather, whereas bumble bees dominated during poor weather. Berries from ßowers exposed only during poor weather had higher fruit set in 1 yr and higher berry weight in the other year compared with enclosed clusters. In both years, clusters exposed only during good weather had Ͼ5 times as many mature seeds, weighed twice as much, and had double the fruit set of those not exposed. No signiÞcant increase over ßowers exposed during good weather was observed when clusters were exposed during good and poor weather. Our results are discussed in terms of the role of weather during bloom on the contribution of bees adapted to foraging during cool conditions.},

	abstract={The role of wind and bees in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F. Liang et A.R. Ferguson) pollination was investigated using large cages enclosing 80 mature vines and assembled so as to prevent insects entering without reducing wind flow within the cages. Monitoring wind speed within the cage and in the open orchard showed that the cages were suitable for such experimentation. Cages without hives, cages with hives, open pollination with hives, and hand pollination were compared during 1990 and 1991. Wind pollination led to an appreciable fruit set (81 and 98% in the first and second year respectively) but fruit weight was low, averaging 61 and 66 g. The use of hives resulted in 98-100% fruit set, but fruit size did not improve significantly, remaining far below that achieved by hand pollination (66 g versus 108 g, the first year; 78 g versus 119 g, the second year). The short flowering period, the frequent adverse weather conditions, and the unpredictable foraging efficiency of bee colonies, made both wind and honey bees inadequate for kiwifruit pollination. Only hand pollination guaranteed maximal fruit size in each year.},

	abstract={A hypothesized underlying principle of the diversity-functioning relationship is that functional groups respond differently to environmental change. Over 3 years, we investigated how pollinator diversity contributes to the magnitude of pollination service through spatial complementarity and differential response to high winds in California almond orchards. We found honey bees preferentially visited the top sections of the tree. Where wild pollinators were present, they showed spatial complementarity to honey bees and visited the bottom tree sections more frequently. As wind speed increased, honey bees’ spatial preference shifted toward the bottom tree sections. In high winds (>2.5 m sÀ1), orchards with low pollinator diversity (honey bees only) received almost no ﬂower visits. In orchards with high pollinator diversity, visitation decreased to a lesser extent as wild bee visitation was unaffected by high winds. Our results demonstrate how spatial complementarity in diverse communities can help buffer pollination services to environmental changes like wind speed.},

	abstract={Pollination, pest control, and soil properties are well known to affect agricultural production. These factors might interactively shape crop yield, but most studies focus on only one of these factors at a time. We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) ﬁelds in Sweden to study how variation among ﬁelds in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The ﬁelds were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reﬂect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also beneﬁted yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator beneﬁts for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.},

	abstract={Insect pollination is a well-studied ecosystem service that supports production in 75% of globally important crops. Although yield is known to be sustained and regulated by a bundle of ecosystem services and management factors, the contribution of pollination to yield has been mostly studied in isolation. Here, we compiled and reviewed research on the contribution of pollination to crop yield under diﬀerent environmental conditions, where the potential interaction between pollination and other factors contributing to yield, such as nutrient availability and control of pests, was tested. Speciﬁcally, we explored whether pollination displayed synergistic, compensatory or additive eﬀects with concomitant factors. The literature search resulted in 24 peer-reviewed studies for a total of 39 individual tests of interactions. Studies examined responses in 13 crops testing interactions both at the local and the landscape scale. Interactions between pollination and other factors inﬂuencing yield were observed for several crops and mostly displayed positive-synergistic relationships. Crop life-history traits such as pollination dependency were found to aﬀect the plant response to variations in resource and pollen availability. Soil properties and crop pests might aﬀect contribution of pollination to yield by altering the amount of resources a plant can allocate to reproduction, independently of the amount of pollen provided. Current management strategies to enhance pollinators might fail to increase pollination beneﬁts in landscapes characterized by poor soil resources or ineﬀective pest control. We propose that our understanding of the eﬀects of crop-pollinator interactions will beneﬁt by focusing on plant traits and physiological responses. Combining knowledge from plant physiology and ecology with technological advances in agriculture is needed to design novel management strategies to maximize pollination beneﬁts and support yields and reduce environmental impacts of food production.},

	abstract={Understanding the role of unmanaged arthropod ﬂower visitors as crop pollinators is critical if robust and reliable long-term alternatives are to be found for honey bee pollination. However, data on pollinator assemblages can be scant. Field observation of crop ﬂower visitors is a common data collection technique but it can be inadequate for species identiﬁcation and is labour-intensive if used across many sites. Trapping may reduce this problem, but trap performance and sampling consistency over long distances (sites separated by >100 km) are rarely examined. Window traps were designed to collect ﬂower-visiting arthropods from peak-ﬂowering onion (Allium cepa) and pak choi (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) ﬁelds across several regions throughout New Zealand. Trap efﬁcacy was evaluated by comparing trapped samples with observations of ﬂower visiting arthropods during the same trapping period, from dawn (6:00 to 7:00 hours) through to dusk (20:00–21:00 hours) at the same locations. Similar types of larger arthropods (length ‡3 mm) were observed and trapped within both crops, with the hymenopteran genera Apidae, Colletidae and Halictidae and the dipteran families Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, Anthomyiidae, Stratiomyidae, Sarcophagidae, Bibionidae, Tachinidae and Muscidae the most commonly recorded. The total counts of these taxa across ﬁelds were strongly correlated between the two methods; however, the ratio of trapped to observed individuals could vary greatly between taxa. Trapping allowed more arthropods to be identiﬁed to the species level and also helped record more small arthropods (body length <3 mm) when compared with observation. Window traps can be effective for assessing the relative diversity of ﬂower visitor assemblages and the abundance of speciﬁc taxa in speciﬁc cropping systems at the regional scale, but variation in trap efﬁciency between arthropod taxa must be assessed for a true measure of assemblage composition.},

	abstract={An increasing amount of information is being collected on the ecological and socio-economic value of goods and services provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature, unpublished government agency reports, and across the World Wide Web. In addition, data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classiﬁed differently by different authors. In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible, a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions, goods and services is needed. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis, a classiﬁcation is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services. In the second part of the paper, a checklist and matrix is provided, linking these ecosystem functions to the main ecological, socio–cultural and economic valuation methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract={Researchers have estimated the total economic value of global ecosystem goods and services showing that a significant portion of humanity‟s economic well being is unaccounted for in conventional GNP accounting (Constanza et al., 1997). To demonstrate this point, authors have conventionally used highly aggregated landscape units for analysis (e.g., biomes), and average, not marginal values, of each ecosystem good or service are estimated for each unit using value transfer methodologies (Wilson et al., 2004). For example, Patterson and Cole (1999a, b) replicated the Constanza et al., (1997) approach by estimating economic values for Waikato and New Zealand ecosystem goods and services associated with standard land cover classes including horticulture, agriculture and cropping. As a result, Patterson and Cole (1999b) argue that only five ecosystem services associated with cropping have non-zero value.},

	abstract={In New Zealand (NZ), literatures on ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems has expanded in recent years as the impact of agriculture on the provision of services to meet public and private demand for ecosystem services are increasingly recognised. We review the NZ literature and analyze the scope of an ecosystem services approach in agro-ecosystems through the lens of four ecosystem service frameworks. Most of the literature is concerned with assessing the beneﬁts that could be gained by changing land management practices. Some research assessed values of ecosystem services to the NZ public. Trade-offs in land-use decisions are highlighted. However, critical gaps in the literature could suggest the impediment of integration of the ecosystem concept into decision-making. The full range of ecosystem services, beneﬁts, and beneﬁciaries had not been covered, and the scope of research is patchy, i.e. limited in spatial and temporal scale. In addition, there is a need to broaden the scope of research to include social and cultural aspects, and link the supply and demand for ecosystem services. Finally, research on the effectiveness of institutions that use an ecosystem services approach could enable better-informed decisions about trade-offs, including all the costs and beneﬁts, across and between multiple scales.},

	pages={112-122},
	note={J2: Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment; 17},
	abstract={A range of policy initiatives have been promoted in recent years to address the decline of bee populations in Europe and North America. Among these has been the establishment of ﬂower-rich habitat within or around intensively farmed landscapes to increase the availability of pollen and nectar resources. The composition of these habitats depends on location and compatibility with adjacent cropping systems, but they often consist of ﬁelds planted with temporary ﬂowering cover crops, ﬁeld borders with perennial or annual ﬂowering species, hedgerows comprising proliﬁcally ﬂowering shrubs, and grass buffer strips (used to manage erosion and nutrient runoff) which are supplemented with dicotyledonous ﬂower species. While the primary objective of such measures is to increase the ecological ﬁtness of pollinator populations through enhanced larval and adult nutrition, such strategies also provide secondary beneﬁts to the farm and the surrounding landscape. Speciﬁcally, the conservation of pollinator habitat can enhance overall biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides (including pest population reduction), protect soil and water quality by mitigating runoff and protecting against soil erosion, and enhance rural aesthetics. Incorporating these secondary beneﬁts into decision making processes is likely to help stakeholders to assess the trade-offs implicit in supplying ecosystem services.},

	note={J2: The American Naturalist; 16},
	abstract={By analyzing 296 published and unpublished data sets describing annual variation in seed output by 144 species of woody plants, this article addresses the following questions. Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit signiﬁcant bimodality in annual seed output? Are there signiﬁcant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did ﬁnd evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon. Associations between supra-annual variability in seed output and pollination and seed dispersal methods suggest the existence of important reproductive correlates that demand further investigation.},

	abstract={The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

	abstract={The concept of ecosystem services was originally developed to illustrate the beneﬁts that natural ecosystems generate for society and to raise awareness for biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. In this article we identify major challenges and opportunities for ecologists involved in empirical or modeling ecosystem service research. The ﬁrst challenge arises from the fact that the ecosystem service concept has not been generated in the context of managed systems. Ecologists need to identify the effect of anthropogenic interventions in order to propose practices to beneﬁt service-providing organisms and associated services. The second challenge arises from the need to evaluate relationships between indicators of ecosystem services that are collected in ecological studies while accounting for uncertainties of ecological processes that underlie these services. We suggest basing the assessment of ecosystem services on the utilization of sets of indicators that cover aspects of service-providing units, ecosystem management and landscape modiﬁcation. The third challenge arises from the limited understanding of the nature of relationships between services and a lack of a general statistical framework to address these links. To manage ecosystem service provisioning, ecologists need to establish whether services respond to a shared driver or if services are directly linked to each other. Finally, studies relating biodiversity to ecosystem services often focus on services at small spatial or short temporal scales, but research on the protection of services is often directed toward services providing beneﬁts at large spatial scales. Ecological research needs to address a range of spatial and temporal scales to provide a multifaceted understanding of how nature promotes human well-being. Addressing these challenges in the future offers a unique opportunity for ecologists to act as promoters for the understanding about how to conserve beneﬁts gained from nature.},

	abstract={Bees are known to provide pollination services to a wide range of crops, yet ﬂies are rarely included in estimates of function. As bees and ﬂies differ markedly in their life history characteristics and resource needs, they may be active and hence provide pollination services at different times of the day. Here, we explore the differences in bee and ﬂy diurnal activity patterns and how this may impact upon pollination services provided to Brassica rapa, a mass-ﬂowering crop. We observed pollinators at two-hourly intervals from 6:00 to 20:00 h in twelve ﬁelds in New Zealand in 2004–2005. Overall, bees were most active in the middle of the day and were more effective pollinators than ﬂies, driven primarily by the high pollinator efﬁciency of Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Some ﬂy taxa however, visited ﬂowers early and late in the day when there were few bees. The results of this study demonstrate that ﬁne-scale temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of crop pollinators may directly affect the quantity of pollination services. The maintenance of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems may therefore be critical to ensure pollinator taxa are available under a range of environmental conditions.},

	abstract={Flower-visiting small arthropods (body length <3 mm) that may vector pollen can be carried via air currents over long distances. Therefore, assessing their diversity, abundance and distribution within crops is an important step in determining their role in the transfer of pollen between crops and weeds leading to crop contamination. A window trap survey of eight ﬂowering pak choi ﬁeld trials in the North and South Islands of New Zealand demonstrated that small arthropods, particularly ﬂies and thrips, were highly abundant within all ﬁelds, greatly dominating arthropod counts. However, the relative abundance of different taxa could vary substantially. For example, Drosophilidae individuals represented 65.5% of total arthropod individuals counted in a Pukekohe ﬁeld and only 7.0% in a Hastings ﬁeld. The large representation of small arthropods within ﬂowering ﬁelds across New Zealand warrants further investigation of their contribution to pollination and pollen ﬂow.},

	abstract={Brassica seed crops are grown throughout New Zealand and worldwide, and inter-crop and crop-weed contamination through gene flow is a major concern. For Brassica, large arthropods (body length > 3 mm), particularly honey bees, are the most important pollinators and are considered key vectors of pollen. Small arthropods (body length < 3 mm) are also abundant in Brassica crops but their role as pollinators is rarely assessed. Numerous small arthropods (particularly Diptera and Thysanoptera) were recorded within cages surrounding pak choi inﬂorescences that excluded large arthropods. Inﬂorescences inside these cages set seed, but seed set was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with inﬂorescences in cages that were hand pollinated and uncaged inﬂorescences. Although the presence of large arthropods signiﬁcantly increased seed set, the role of small arthropods and wind cannot be excluded in pak choi pollination. Further studies are required to fully determine the role of small arthropods in long distance pollen ﬂow.},

	abstract={Ecosystem services (ES) such as pollination are vital for the continuous supply of food to a growing human population, but the decline in populations of insect pollinators worldwide poses a threat to food and nutritional security. Using a pollinator (honeybee) exclusion approach, we evaluated the impact of pollinator scarcity on production in four brassica ﬁelds, two producing hybrid seeds and two producing open-pollinated ones. There was a clear reduction in seed yield as pollination rates declined. Open-pollinated crops produced signiﬁcantly higher yields than did the hybrid ones at all pollination rates. The hybrid crops required at least 0.50 of background pollination rates to achieve maximum yield, whereas in open-pollinated crops, 0.25 pollination rates were necessary for maximum yield. The total estimated economic value of pollination services provided by honeybees to the agricultural industry in New Zealand is NZD $1.96 billion annually. This study indicates that loss of pollination services can result in signiﬁcant declines in production and have serious implications for the market economy in New Zealand. Depending on the extent of honeybee population decline, and assuming that results in declining pollination services, the estimated economic loss to New Zealand agriculture could be in the range of NZD $295–728 million annually.},
